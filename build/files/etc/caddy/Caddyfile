# To serve your site over HTTPS, make sure your domain's A/AAAA
# DNS records are properly pointed to this machine's public IP,
# then change the line below to your domain name.
:80

# Set this to your site's root path.
root * /usr/share/caddy

# Enable the static file server.

# Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
# reverse_proxy localhost:8080

# Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
# php_fastcgi localhost:9000
